# Clustering-Algorithm-
Clustering Algorithms on Iris Dataset

Objective:
The objective of this notebook is to evaluate and apply clustering techniques to the Iris dataset, which contains data about the features of different Iris flowers. We will implement and visualize the results of both KMeans and Hierarchical clustering.

Clustering Algorithms Implemented
KMeans Clustering:

KMeans is an unsupervised learning algorithm that divides a dataset into a specified number of clusters (K) by iteratively assigning data points to the closest cluster center and adjusting the cluster centers until convergence.

Hierarchical Clustering:

Hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) to represent the nested clusters. It does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance.

Dependencies

To run the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

sklearn
